# Melody

**NOTE:** We are moving away from docker-compose, so the ` docker-compose ` process
may not work any more. You can still run this project locally by setting it up as if
cloning a conventional Django project in */services* and a conventional node/nuxtjs
project in *clients/web*.

### Getting Started

- ` git clone https://github.com/MelodyBoard/Melody `
- ` git submodule update --init `
- ` docker-compose build `
- ` docker-compose up `
- Visit http://localhost:8080/
